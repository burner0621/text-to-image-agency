# txt2imghd

txt2imghd is a port of the GOBIG mode from [progrockdiffusion]applied to [Stable Diffusion], with [Real-ESRGAN] as the upscaler. It creates detailed, higher-resolution images by first generating an image from a prompt, upscaling it, and then running img2img on smaller pieces of the upscaled image, and blending the result back into the original image.

txt2imghd with default settings has the same VRAM requirements as regular Stable Diffusion, although generation of the detailed images will take longer.

## Installation

1. Have a working repository of [Stable Diffusion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)
2. Copy `txt2imghd.py` into `scripts/`
3. Download the appropriate [release of Real-ESRGAN] (the respective `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan` .zip for your OS) and unzip it into the root of your Stable Diffusion repository

## Running

txt2imghd has most of the same parameters as txt2img. `ddim_steps` has been renamed to `steps`. The `strength` parameter controls how much detailing to do (between 0.0-1.0). If no `prompt` is given on the command line, the program will ask for it as input.

```sh
python scripts/txt2imghd.py
```

txt2imghd will output three images: the original Stable Diffusion image, the upscaled version (denoted by a `u` suffix), and the detailed version (denoted by the `ud` suffix).
